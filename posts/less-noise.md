In a world full of constant notifications, breaking news, endless updates and loud opinions, I’ve started craving less noise. Especially digital noise.

I used to wake up and instantly check my phone. Emails, messages, trending topics. It felt like the day started with a mental traffic jam. But lately, I’ve been turning things off one by one.

I disabled push notifications. I muted group chats. I deleted apps that made me scroll without thinking. And something surprising happened. I could think clearly again.

Technology isn’t the enemy. But how we use it shapes how we feel. When every app is fighting for your attention, peace becomes a choice. And sometimes even a quiet rebellion.

Now my phone feels quieter. My mind too. I still love tech. But now I use it with intention. Because in a world full of digital noise, silence feels like freedom.
