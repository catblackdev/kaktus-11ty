When I first started coding, I believed it was all about knowing the correct syntax. But I soon realized that it's really about learning how to fail and how to keep going despite it.

Error messages may seem intimidating at first, but over time, they become familiar. You begin to notice patterns, anticipate problems and solve them more efficiently.

Coding is not about avoiding failure. It's about failing many times and still returning with curiosity. If you're making mistakes, you're right where you should be.
