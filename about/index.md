## About

Hey! I’m a software engineer and designer — which basically means I argue with myself a lot. One side wants clean code, the other wants pretty pixels. Spoiler: they both end up drinking coffee and staying up late.

I build apps that work smoothly (most of the time) and look decent enough to show your mom. I'm the type of person who debugs at 2 AM and redesigns a button just because it “feels off.” I believe good design makes people smile, and good code doesn’t crash.

If you ever meet me, just bring coffee. That’s the true programming language.
