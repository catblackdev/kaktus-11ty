## About me

Hey there! I write code and design stuff — which means some nights I’m debugging till 4 AM, and other days I’m moving a pixel 1mm to the left like it’s a matter of life and death. Perfect balance? Nah, just chronic indecision.

I’m either a developer obsessed with visuals or a designer hiding from code — still not sure. But I try to do both as best as I can. My apps usually work (if they don’t crash, I’m happy), and my designs aren’t too bad on the eyes.

Here, I write about this chaotic soup of design and development. Part rant, part reminder, fully me. If you’ve stumbled across this page, grab a coffee and hang out — no pressure, no corporate talk, just vibes.
